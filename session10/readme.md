##Step by Step SpY SPI

SPI is Serial Peripherial Interface. It's a common serial communication for communicating and controlling electronic components and other microcontrollers.


##General SPI information
[SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus)

##Wiring Diagrams

We're going to attach two Fubarino Mini, Fubarino SD, or Arduino boards to each other.

##Concept
Each person can connect to then next persons Arduino and communicate information to each other. We will use a Sealae Logic Analyzer to look at the information being exchanged. We'll use basic transaction between device.



###Code Review
* SPI is a built in library
* Digilent Inc created a full implementation of SPI called DSPI
* How to install the library
* Program the Hello SPI sketch
* Debug the wiring
* Debug the code

###Custom Code
* TBD
