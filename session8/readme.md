##Concept
The idea is we need to know the rotation of a motor. Both the revolutions per minute (RPM) and the exact position of the motor. The AS5047D Rotary Sensor can do this in multiple ways.
1. It can give us RPM.
2. We can get position for a single pole to a 7 pole motor.
3. The 7 pole motor is a a brushless car alternator we're going to use with the Power Racing Series car.
