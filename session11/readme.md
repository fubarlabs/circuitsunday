##Assorted Analog Sensors

This expands on the analogRead() and digitalREad() functions for reading values from a potentiometer. We'll explore a whole box full of different sensors.


##reading from devices
* int val = analogRead(ANALOG PIN NUMBER)
* boolean state = digitalRead(DIGITAL PIN NUMBER)


##Wiring Diagrams
We'll add additional fritzings and circuit diagrams of the circuit as we go.

###Code Review

###Custom Code
